# Final Grade 
For this class I will put my efforts at a C. I was so scared for my life when i came in my first day I didn't belive in myelf when i sat down and you said on the first day
that you want to help us succed in this class you really meant it even though it was a tough challgening class it changed my mind on Linux.
I missed my final exam due to that i was sick and i wasnt in class and would like to re fix that ASAP to boost my grade up.
Over all my grade i will put my self at a C.
